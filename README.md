-> i have used jFrame technolodgy here.

-> JFrames are top-level containers provided by Java Swing which provide a playground for designing components. JFrames are also known as base windows on which other components such as menu bars, panels, labels, text fields, buttons, etc. rely. Almost every Java Swing application starts with the JFrame window.
